0.0.3: First public release.
0.0.4: 
* (Possibly) Fixed compilation error, when not on OpenFL _v2.
* Small cleanup of code
* Added basic support for HTML5. Only Bitfive support right now.
1.1.4:
* Changing versioning system to SemVer.
* Added documentation.
* Added basic asynchronous parsing for neko and cpp tarets (via Threads).
* Fixed dumb error in LZW decoding, which resulted in infinite loop.
* Fixed error in Wrapper. (Assumption that DisplayObject receives EnterFrame event even if it's not in display list is wrong on OpenFL)
